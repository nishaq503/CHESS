# Clustered Hierarchical Entropy-Scaling Search of Astrophysical and Biological Data

CHESS is a search algorithm for large data sets when the data exhibits certain geometric properties.

All classes and functions are very well documented in the code. If you want more details, read them.
The [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08551.pdf) is available on the arXiv.
